                    <h2>School</h2>
                    <p>As of 2026, I am a 2nd year college student in FEU Institute of Technology taking the course of BS Information Technology Web Development and Mobile Application.</p>
                    <p>I liked learning about web development and technology, the same way I am passionate about exploring the world of IT.</p>

                    <p>My former school in senior high school was FEU Diliman with the strand, STEM Engineering. This was a different path from my chosen course so it was difficult to adjust.</p>
                    <p>However, I was able to overcome the challenges and I am now enjoying my journey in college.</p>
